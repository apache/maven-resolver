/**
 * Credentials provider that helps to isolate server from proxy credentials. Apache HttpClient uses a single provider
 * for both server and proxy auth, using the auth scope (host, port, etc.) to select the proper credentials. With regard
 * to redirects, we use an auth scope for server credentials that's not specific enough to not be mistaken for proxy
 * auth. This provider helps to maintain the proper isolation.
