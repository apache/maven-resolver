This module implement named locks using Hazelcast. It provides two implementations, that are distributed and rely on
Hazelcast 4.x ISemaphores.

Out of the box "hazelcast" (distributed) named lock implementations are following:

- `semaphore-hazelcast` implemented in `org.eclipse.aether.named.hazelcast.HazelcastCPSemaphoreNamedLockFactory` that uses
  Hazelcast backed `com.hazelcast.cp.ISemaphore`. Full Hazelcast member is used here.
- `semaphore-hazelcast-client` implemented in `org.eclipse.aether.named.hazelcast.HazelcastClientCPSemaphoreNamedLockFactory`
  that uses Hazelcast Client backed `com.hazelcast.cp.ISemaphore`. This implementation uses Hazelcast Client, so
  connection to some existing Hazelcast cluster, and its existence is a requirement.

${esc.hash}${esc.hash} Open Issues/Notes

- It only works when Sisu DI is used and not the bundled `AetherModule` or
  `ServiceLocator` (Maven uses Sisu dependency injection).
- Usage from plugins has not been tested yet.
- The `furnace-maven-plugin` does not work this implementation because it uses `ServiceLocator` instead
  of dependency injection.

${esc.hash}${esc.hash} Installation/Testing

- Create the directory `${maven.home}/lib/ext/hazelcast/`.
- Modify `${maven.home}/bin/m2.conf` by adding `load ${maven.home}/lib/ext/hazelcast/*.jar`
  right after the `${maven.conf}/logging` line.
- Copy the following dependency from Maven Central to `${maven.home}/lib/ext/hazelcast/`:
      <pre class="source">
      ├── <a href="https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/com/hazelcast/hazelcast/4.1.1/hazelcast-4.1.1.jar">hazelcast-4.1.1.jar</a></pre>
- Optionally configure Hazelcast instance with `${maven.conf}/hazelcast.xml` or `${maven.conf}/hazelcast-client.xml`
  (see Hazelcast documentation for possibilities, or, see test resources of this project as starter).
- Now start a multithreaded Maven build on your project and make sure `NamedSyncContextFactory` is being used.
