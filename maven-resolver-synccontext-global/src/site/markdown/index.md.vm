The Global Sync Context is Java global lock factory for Maven Resolver to provide a concurrent-safe
access from a single Maven instance to the same local Maven repository.

For further details about the factory read the [Javadoc](./apidocs/org/eclipse/aether/synccontext/GlobalSyncContextFactory.html).

${esc.hash}${esc.hash} Open Issues/Notes

- It only works when dependency injection is used and not the bundled `AetherModule` or
  `ServiceLocator` (Maven uses dependency injection).
- Usage from plugins has not been tested yet.
- The `furnace-maven-plugin` does not work this implementation because it uses `ServiceLocator` instead
  of dependency injection.
- The installation process has not been streamlined yet.

${esc.hash}${esc.hash} Installation/Testing

- Clone Maven Resolver, switch to `MRESOLVER-130` branch and perform `mvn install`.
- Clone Maven, switch to `master` branch, change the Resolver version in Maven's parent POM: `${project.version}`.
- Extract `apache-maven-3.7.0-SNAPSHOT-bin.tar.gz` to a location of your choice.
- Add/modify the following entries in `${maven.home}/conf/logging/simplelogger.properties`:
      ```
      org.slf4j.simpleLogger.showDateTime=true
      org.slf4j.simpleLogger.showThreadName=true
      org.slf4j.simpleLogger.showShortLogName=true
      org.slf4j.simpleLogger.log.org.eclipse.aether=trace
      ```
- Go back to Resolver and run `mvn dependency:copy-dependencies -pl maven-resolver-synccontext-global`.
- Copy the following dependencies from `maven-resolver-synccontext-global/target/dependency`
  to `${maven.home}/lib/ext/`:
      ```
      ├── javax.annotation-api-1.3.2.jar
      └── maven-resolver-synccontext-global-${project.version}.jar
      ```
    Dependencies which are already bundled with Maven have been omitted.
- Now start a multithreaded Maven (`3.7.0-SNAPSHOT`) build on your project and you should see at least these lines:
      ```
      4626 [main] [TRACE] GlobalSyncContextFactory$GlobalSyncContext - Acquiring global...
      35318 [main] [TRACE] GlobalSyncContextFactory$GlobalSyncContext - Releasing global...
      ```
