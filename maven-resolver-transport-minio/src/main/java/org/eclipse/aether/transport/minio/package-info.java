 * Support for downloads/uploads via the S3 protocol. The implementation is backed by
 * <a href="https://github.com/minio/minio-java">MinIO Java</a>.
 * The repository URL should be defined with protocol {@code minio+http} or {@code s3+http}. Note: use "https" if
 * you are going for HTTPS remote, factory will merely strip "minio+" or "s3+" prefix assuming resulting URL will
 * point to expected S3 endpoint.
