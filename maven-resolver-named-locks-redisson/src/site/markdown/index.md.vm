This module implement named locks using Redisson. It provides two implementations, that are distributed and rely on
Redisson distributed objects feature.

Out of the box "redisson" (distributed) named lock implementations are the following:

- `rwlock-redisson` implemented in `org.eclipse.aether.named.redisson.RedissonReadWriteLockNamedLockFactory`
  that uses Redisson-backed `org.redisson.api.RReadWriteLock`.
- `semaphore-redisson` implemented in `org.eclipse.aether.named.redisson.RedissonSemaphoreNamedLockFactory`
  that uses Redisson-backed `org.redisson.api.RSemaphore`.

To use this implementation within your project, depending on how you integrate, you have following options:
- If you use Sisu DI, then all you need is to provide this module (and its dependencies) on classpath and you are done.
- If you use Guice, you need to add this module (and its dependencies) upfront, and bind them explicitly.
- If you use ServiceLocator, this module will not work.

${esc.hash}${esc.hash} Installation/Testing

- Create the directory `${maven.home}/lib/ext/redisson/` (if it does not exist).
- Unzip the following bundle from Maven Central to `${maven.home}/lib/ext/redisson/`:
  <pre class="source">
  └── <a href="https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/org/apache/maven/resolver/${project.artifactId}/${project.version}/${project.artifactId}-${project.version}-bundle.zip">${project.artifactId}-${project.version}-bundle.zip</a></pre>
- Start your Redis instance on `localhost` or configure a remote instance with `${maven.conf}/maven-resolver-redisson.yaml`.
- Now start a multithreaded Maven build or multiple builds (e.g., CI server) on your project.
