Since version 1.7.0, Maven Resolver requires Java 8 to run and a brand new default sync context
factory has been implemented. Both are not compatible with Maven 3.8.x anymore which still requires
Java 7 to run. Maven 3.8.x will continue to use version 1.6.x which you will find
[here](/resolver-archives/resolver-1.6.3/).
This also means that you cannot make use of the features provided by version 1.7.0 and later.
If you require the changes from this version, but must use Maven 3.8.x, you can build yourself an adapted version
of Maven from the branch [`maven-3.8.x-resolver-1.8.x`](https://github.com/apache/maven/tree/maven-3.8.x-resolver-1.8.x)
with Java 8 requirement or use signed binaries and source from the [dev dist area](https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/maven/maven-3/3.8.x-resolver-1.8.x/)
and use it as if you would use Maven 3.9.x.
