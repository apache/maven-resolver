| `"aether.transport.http.supportWebDav"` | `Boolean` | Boolean flag should the HTTP transport support WebDAV remote. Not all transport support this option. |  `false`  | 2.0.0 (moved out from maven-resolver-transport-http). |  Yes  | Session Configuration |
| `"aether.transport.http.userAgent"` | `String` | The user agent that repository connectors should report to servers. |  `"Aether"`  |  |  No  | Session Configuration |
| `"aether.transport.https.securityMode"` | `String` | The mode that sets HTTPS transport "security mode": to ignore any SSL errors (certificate validity checks, hostname verification). The default value is <code>#HTTPS_SECURITY_MODE_DEFAULT</code> . |  `"default"`  | 1.9.6 |  Yes  | Session Configuration |
| `"aether.transport.jdk.httpVersion"` | `String` | Use string representation of HttpClient version enum "HTTP_2" or "HTTP_1_1" to set default HTTP protocol to use. |  `"HTTP_1_1"`  | 2.0.0 |  Yes  | Session Configuration |
| `"aether.transport.jdk.maxConcurrentRequests"` | `Integer` | The hard limit of maximum concurrent requests JDK transport can do. This is a workaround for the fact, that in HTTP/2 mode, JDK HttpClient initializes this value to Integer.MAX_VALUE (!) and lowers it on first response from the remote server (but it may be too late). See JDK bug <a href="https://bugs.openjdk.org/browse/JDK-8225647">JDK-8225647</a> for details. |  `100`  | 2.0.0 |  Yes  | Session Configuration |
| `"aether.transport.jetty.followRedirects"` | `Boolean` | If enabled, Jetty client will follow HTTP redirects. |  `true`  | 2.0.1 |  Yes  | Session Configuration |
| `"aether.transport.jetty.maxRedirects"` | `Integer` | The max redirect count to follow. |  `5`  | 2.0.1 |  Yes  | Session Configuration |
| `"aether.transport.minio.fixedBucketName"` | `String` | The fixed bucket name to use. |  `"maven"`  | 2.0.2 |  Yes  | Session Configuration |
| `"aether.transport.minio.objectNameMapper"` | `String` | Object name mapper to use. |  `"fixedBucket"`  | 2.0.2 |  Yes  | Session Configuration |
| `"aether.transport.wagon.config"` | `Object` | The configuration to use for the Wagon provider. |  -  |  |  Yes  | Session Configuration |
| `"aether.transport.wagon.perms.dirMode"` | `String` | Octal numerical notation of permissions to set for newly created directories. Only considered by certain Wagon providers. |  -  |  |  Yes  | Session Configuration |
| `"aether.transport.wagon.perms.fileMode"` | `String` | Octal numerical notation of permissions to set for newly created files. Only considered by certain Wagon providers. |  -  |  |  Yes  | Session Configuration |
| `"aether.transport.wagon.perms.group"` | `String` | Group which should own newly created directories/files. Only considered by certain Wagon providers. |  -  |  |  Yes  | Session Configuration |
| `"aether.trustedChecksumsSource.sparseDirectory"` | `Boolean` | Is checksum source enabled? |  `false`  | 1.9.0 |  No  | Session Configuration |
| `"aether.trustedChecksumsSource.sparseDirectory.basedir"` | `String` | The basedir where checksums are. If relative, is resolved from local repository root. |  `".checksums"`  | 1.9.0 |  No  | Session Configuration |
| `"aether.trustedChecksumsSource.sparseDirectory.originAware"` | `Boolean` | Is source origin aware? |  `true`  | 1.9.0 |  No  | Session Configuration |
| `"aether.trustedChecksumsSource.summaryFile"` | `Boolean` | Is checksum source enabled? |  `false`  | 1.9.0 |  No  | Session Configuration |
| `"aether.trustedChecksumsSource.summaryFile.basedir"` | `String` | The basedir where checksums are. If relative, is resolved from local repository root. |  `".checksums"`  | 1.9.0 |  No  | Session Configuration |
| `"aether.trustedChecksumsSource.summaryFile.originAware"` | `Boolean` | Is source origin aware? |  `true`  | 1.9.0 |  No  | Session Configuration |
| `"aether.updateCheckManager.sessionState"` | `String` | Manages the session state, i.e. influences if the same download requests to artifacts/metadata will happen multiple times within the same RepositorySystemSession. If "enabled" will enable the session state. If "bypass" will enable bypassing (i.e. store all artifact ids/metadata ids which have been updates but not evaluating those). All other values lead to disabling the session state completely. |  `"enabled"`  |  |  No  | Session Configuration |


All properties which have `yes` in the column `Supports Repo ID Suffix` can be optionally configured specifically for a repository id. In that case the configuration property needs to be suffixed with a period followed by the repository id of the repository to configure, e.g. `aether.connector.http.headers.central` for repository with id `central`.

## Property Type Conversion

If the value is not given in the target type the following conversions are applied.

From | To | With
--- | --- | ---
`String` | `boolean` | [`Boolean.parseBoolean(...)`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/Boolean.html#parseBoolean(java.lang.String))
`String` | `int` | [`Integer.parseInt(...)`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/Integer.html#parseInt(java.lang.String))
`String` | `long` | [`Long.parseLong(...)`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/Long.html#parseLong(java.lang.String))
`String` | `float` | [`Float.parseFloat(...)`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/Float.html#parseFloat(java.lang.String))

## Set Configuration from Apache Maven

To set one of the configuration options from above just use system variables. As system variables only support String values the type conversion mentioned above needs to be leveraged.
Sometimes Maven uses different default values than the Maven Resolver itself or tries to extract certain values from the `settings.xml`. For details refer to [`DefaultRepositorySystemSessionFactory`](https://github.com/apache/maven/blob/master/impl/maven-core/src/main/java/org/apache/maven/internal/aether/DefaultRepositorySystemSessionFactory.java).
