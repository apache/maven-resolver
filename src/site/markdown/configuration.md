By default uses "hard" references (consume more heap, but is faster). Using "weak" will make resolver much more memory conservative, at the cost of up to 10% slower collecting dependency speed (system and Java dependent). Supported values: `"hard"`, `"weak"`.                                                                                                       | `"hard"`                                                                                   | no                      |

If `"enabled"` will enable the session state. If `"bypass"` will enable bypassing (i.e. store all artifact ids/metadata ids which have been updates but not evaluating those). All other values lead to disabling the session state completely.                                                                                                      | `"enabled"`                                                                                | no                      |

All properties which have `yes` in the column `Supports Repo ID Suffix` can be optionally configured specifically for a repository id. In that case the configuration property needs to be suffixed with a period followed by the repository id of the repository to configure, e.g. `aether.connector.http.headers.central` for repository with id `central`.

## Property Type Conversion

If the value is not given in the target type the following conversions are applied.

| From     | To        | With                                                                                                                           |
|----------|-----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `String` | `boolean` | [`Boolean.parseBoolean(...)`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Boolean.html#parseBoolean(java.lang.String)) |
| `String` | `int`     | [`Integer.parseInt(...)`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Integer.html#parseInt(java.lang.String))         |
| `String` | `long`    | [`Long.parseLong(...)`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Long.html#parseLong(java.lang.String))             |
| `String` | `float`   | [`Float.parseFloat(...)`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Float.html#parseFloat(java.lang.String))         |

## Set Configuration from Apache Maven

To set one of the configuration options from above just use system variables. As system variables only support String values the type conversion mentioned above needs to be leveraged.
Sometimes Maven uses different default values than the Maven Resolver itself or tries to extract certain values from the `settings.xml`. For details refer to <https://github.com/apache/maven/blob/maven-3.9.x/maven-core/src/main/java/org/apache/maven/internal/aether/DefaultRepositorySystemSessionFactory.java>.
