| `"aether.artifactResolver.postProcessor.trustedChecksums.checksumAlgorithms"` | `String` | The checksum algorithms to apply during post-processing as comma separated list. |  `"SHA-1"`  | 1.9.0 |  No  | Session Configuration |
| `"aether.artifactResolver.postProcessor.trustedChecksums.failIfMissing"` | `Boolean` | Should post processor fail resolution if checksum is missing? |  `false`  | 1.9.0 |  No  | Session Configuration |
| `"aether.artifactResolver.postProcessor.trustedChecksums.record"` | `Boolean` | Should post processor go into "record" mode (and collect checksums instead of validate them)? |  `false`  | 1.9.0 |  No  | Session Configuration |
| `"aether.artifactResolver.postProcessor.trustedChecksums.scope"` | `String` | The scope to apply during post-processing. Accepted values are <code>all</code> (is default and is what happened before), and <code>project</code> when the scope of verification are project dependencies only (i.e. plugins are not verified). |  `"all"`  | 2.0.11 |  No  | Session Configuration |
| `"aether.artifactResolver.postProcessor.trustedChecksums.snapshots"` | `Boolean` | Should post processor process snapshots as well? |  `false`  | 1.9.0 |  No  | Session Configuration |
| `"aether.artifactResolver.simpleLrmInterop"` | `Boolean` | Configuration to enable "interoperability" with Simple LRM, but this breaks RRF feature, hence this configuration is IGNORED when RRF is used, and is warmly recommended to leave it disabled even if no RRF is being used. |  `false`  |  |  No  | Session Configuration |
| `"aether.artifactResolver.snapshotNormalization"` | `Boolean` | Configuration to enable "snapshot normalization", downloaded snapshots from remote with timestamped file names will have file names converted back to baseVersion. It replaces the timestamped snapshot file name with a filename containing the SNAPSHOT qualifier only. This only affects resolving/retrieving artifacts but not uploading those. |  `true`  |  |  No  | Session Configuration |
| `"aether.chainedLocalRepository.ignoreTailAvailability"` | `Boolean` | When using chained local repository, should be the artifact availability ignored in tail. |  `true`  | 1.9.2 |  No  | Session Configuration |
| `"aether.checksums.omitChecksumsForExtensions"` | `String` | Comma-separated list of extensions with leading dot (example ".asc") that should have checksums omitted.

| `"aether.conflictResolver.path.showCyclesInStandardVerbosity"` | `Boolean` | This implementation of conflict resolver is able to show more precise information regarding cycles in standard verbose mode. But, to make it really drop-in-replacement, we "tame down" this information. Still, users needing it may want to enable this for easier cycle detection, but in that case this conflict resolver will provide "extra nodes" not present on "standard verbosity level" with "classic" conflict resolver, that may lead to IT issues down the stream. Hence, the default is to provide as much information as much verbose "classic" does. |  `false`  | 2.0.12 |  No  | Session Configuration |
| `"aether.conflictResolver.verbose"` | `Object` | The key in the repository session's <code>org.eclipse.aether.RepositorySystemSession#getConfigProperties() configuration properties</code> used to store a <code>Boolean</code> flag controlling the transformer's verbose mode.

| `"aether.connector.basic.smartChecksums"` | `Boolean` | Flag indicating that instead of comparing the external checksum fetched from the remote repo with the calculated one, it should try to extract the reference checksum from the actual artifact response headers This only works for HTTP transports. |  `true`  | 0.9.0.M3 |  No  | Session Configuration |
| `"aether.connector.basic.threads"` | `Integer` | Number of threads in basic connector for uploading/downloading. Observed only if some of the upstream or downstream threads are not set. (Deprecated) |  `5`  | 0.9.0.M4 |  No  | Session Configuration |

| `"aether.dependencyCollector.bf.threads"` | `Integer` | The count of threads to be used when collecting POMs in parallel. |  `5`  | 1.9.0 |  No  | Session Configuration |
| `"aether.dependencyCollector.impl"` | `String` | The name of the dependency collector implementation to use: depth-first (original) named "df", and breadth-first (new in 1.8.0) named "bf". Both collectors produce equivalent results, but they may differ performance wise, depending on project being applied to. Our experience shows that existing "df" is well suited for smaller to medium size projects, while "bf" may perform better on huge projects with many dependencies. Experiment (and come back to us!) to figure out which one suits you the better. |  `"bf"`  | 1.8.0 |  No  | Session Configuration |

| `"aether.named.file-lock.attempts"` | `Integer` | Tweak: on Windows, the presence of <em>StandardOpenOption#DELETE_ON_CLOSE</em> causes concurrency issues. This flag allows to implement similar fix as referenced JDK bug report: retry and hope the best. Default value is 5 attempts (will retry 4 times). |  `5`  | 1.7.3 |  No  | Java System Properties |
| `"aether.named.file-lock.deleteLockFiles"` | `Boolean` | Tweak: on Windows, the presence of <em>StandardOpenOption#DELETE_ON_CLOSE</em> causes concurrency issues. This flag allows to have it removed from effective flags, at the cost that lockfile directory becomes crowded with 0 byte sized lock files that are never cleaned up. Default value is <code>true</code> on non-Windows OS. See <a href="https://bugs.openjdk.org/browse/JDK-8252883">JDK-8252883</a> for Windows related bug.

If the class name ends with Factory that suffix could optionally be left out. This configuration is used by <code>org.eclipse.aether.internal.impl.PrioritizedComponents</code> internal utility to sort classes by priority. This is reusable utility (so an extension can make use of it), but by default in "vanilla" Resolver following classes are sorted: <ul> <li> <code>org.eclipse.aether.spi.localrepo.LocalRepositoryManagerFactory</code> </li> <li> <code>org.eclipse.aether.spi.connector.RepositoryConnectorFactory</code> </li> <li> <code>org.eclipse.aether.spi.connector.layout.RepositoryLayoutFactory</code> </li> <li> <code>org.eclipse.aether.spi.connector.transport.TransporterFactory</code> </li> <li> <code>org.eclipse.aether.spi.artifact.decorator.ArtifactDecoratorFactory</code> </li> <li> <code>org.eclipse.aether.spi.artifact.generator.ArtifactGeneratorFactory</code> </li> <li> <code>org.eclipse.aether.impl.MetadataGeneratorFactory</code> </li> </ul> |  -  |  |  No  | Session Configuration |

| `"aether.priority.implicit"` | `Boolean` | A flag indicating whether the priorities of pluggable extensions are implicitly given by their iteration order such that the first extension has the highest priority. If set, an extension's built-in priority as well as any corresponding <code>aether.priority.*</code> configuration properties are ignored when searching for a suitable implementation among the available extensions. This priority mode is meant for cases where the application will present/inject extensions in the desired search order. |  `false`  |  |  No  | Session Configuration |
| `"aether.remoteRepositoryFilter.groupId"` | `Boolean` | Configuration to enable the GroupId filter (enabled by default). Can be fine-tuned per repository using repository ID suffixes. <strong>Important:</strong> For this filter to take effect, you must provide configuration files. Without configuration files, the enabled filter remains dormant and does not interfere with resolution. <strong>Configuration Files:</strong> <ul> <li>Location: Directory specified by <code>#CONFIG_PROP_BASEDIR</code> (defaults to <code>$LOCAL_REPO/.remoteRepositoryFilters</code> )</li> <li>Naming: <code>groupId-$(repository.id).txt</code> </li> <li>Content: One groupId per line to allow/block from the repository</li> </ul> <strong>Recommended Setup (Per-Project):</strong> Use project-specific configuration to avoid repository ID clashes. Add to <code>.mvn/maven.config</code> : <pre> -Daether.remoteRepositoryFilter.groupId=true -Daether.remoteRepositoryFilter.groupId.basedir=${session.rootDirectory}/.mvn/rrf/ </pre> Then create <code>groupId-myrepoId.txt</code> files in the <code>.mvn/rrf/</code> directory and commit them to version control. |  `true`  | 1.9.0 |  Yes  | Session Configuration |

| `"aether.remoteRepositoryFilter.groupId.skipped"` | `Boolean` | Configuration to skip the GroupId filter for given request. This configuration is evaluated and if <code>true</code> the GroupId remote filter will not kick in. |  `false`  | 2.0.14 |  Yes  | Session Configuration |
| `"aether.remoteRepositoryFilter.prefixes"` | `Boolean` | Configuration to enable the Prefixes filter (enabled by default). Can be fine-tuned per repository using repository ID suffixes. <strong>Important:</strong> For this filter to take effect, configuration files must be available. Without configuration files, the enabled filter remains dormant and does not interfere with resolution. <strong>Configuration File Resolution:</strong> <ol> <li><strong>User-provided files:</strong> Checked first from directory specified by <code>#CONFIG_PROP_BASEDIR</code> (defaults to <code>$LOCAL_REPO/.remoteRepositoryFilters</code> )</li> <li><strong>Auto-discovery:</strong> If not found, attempts to download from remote repository and cache locally</li> </ol> <strong>File Naming:</strong> <code>prefixes-$(repository.id).txt</code> <strong>Recommended Setup (Auto-Discovery with Override Capability):</strong> Start with auto-discovery, but prepare for project-specific overrides. Add to <code>.mvn/maven.config</code> : <pre> -Daether.remoteRepositoryFilter.prefixes=true -Daether.remoteRepositoryFilter.prefixes.basedir=${session.rootDirectory}/.mvn/rrf/ </pre> <strong>Initial setup:</strong> Don't provide any files - rely on auto-discovery as repositories are accessed. <strong>Override when needed:</strong> Create <code>prefixes-myrepoId.txt</code> files in <code>.mvn/rrf/</code> and commit to version control. <strong>Caching:</strong> Auto-discovered prefix files are cached in the local repository. |  `true`  | 1.9.0 |  Yes  | Session Configuration |
| `"aether.remoteRepositoryFilter.prefixes.basedir"` | `String` | The basedir where to store filter files. If path is relative, it is resolved from local repository root. |  `".remoteRepositoryFilters"`  | 1.9.0 |  No  | Session Configuration |
| `"aether.remoteRepositoryFilter.prefixes.skipped"` | `Boolean` | Configuration to skip the Prefixes filter for given request. This configuration is evaluated and if <code>true</code> the prefixes remote filter will not kick in. Main use case is by filter itself, to prevent recursion during discovery of remote prefixes file, but this also allows other components to control prefix filter discovery, while leaving configuration like <code>#CONFIG_PROP_ENABLED</code> still show the "real state". |  `false`  | 2.0.14 |  Yes  | Session Configuration |
| `"aether.remoteRepositoryFilter.prefixes.useMirroredRepositories"` | `Boolean` | Configuration to allow Prefixes filter to auto-discover prefixes from mirrored repositories as well. For this to work <em>Maven should be aware</em> that given remote repository is mirror and is usually backed by MRM. Given multiple MRM implementations messes up prefixes file, is better to just skip these. In other case, one may use <code>#CONFIG_PROP_ENABLED</code> with repository ID suffix. |  `false`  | 2.0.14 |  Yes  | Session Configuration |
| `"aether.remoteRepositoryFilter.prefixes.useRepositoryManagers"` | `Boolean` | Configuration to allow Prefixes filter to auto-discover prefixes from repository managers as well. For this to work <em>Maven should be aware</em> that given remote repository is backed by repository manager. Given multiple MRM implementations messes up prefixes file, is better to just skip these.

| `"aether.remoteRepositoryFilter.repositoryKeyFunction"` | `String` | <b>Experimental:</b> Configuration for "repository key" function. Note: repository key functions other than "nid" produce repository keys will be <em>way different that those produced with previous versions or without this option enabled</em>.

| `"aether.remoteRepositoryManager.repositoryKeyFunction"` | `String` | <b>Experimental:</b> Configuration for "repository key" function. Note: repository key functions other than "nid" produce repository keys will be <em>way different that those produced with previous versions or without this option enabled</em>. Manager uses this key to detect "same" remote repositories, and in case of mirrors, to merge them. |  `"nid"`  | 2.0.14 |  No  | Session Configuration |
| `"aether.snapshotFilter"` | `Boolean` | The key in the repository session's <code>RepositorySystemSession#getConfigProperties() configurationproperties</code> used to store a <code>Boolean</code> flag whether this filter should be forced to ban snapshots. By default, snapshots are only filtered if the root artifact is not a snapshot. |  `false`  |  |  No  | Session Configuration |
| `"aether.syncContext.named.basedir.locksDir"` | `String` | The location of the directory toi use for locks. If relative path, it is resolved from the local repository root. |  `".locks"`  | 1.9.0 |  No  | Session Configuration |

| `"aether.transport.http.requestTimeout"` | `Integer` | The maximum amount of time (in milliseconds) to wait for remaining data to arrive from a remote server. Note that this timeout does not restrict the overall duration of a request, it only restricts the duration of inactivity between consecutive data packets. Non-positive values indicate no timeout. |  `1800000`  |  |  Yes  | Session Configuration |
| `"aether.transport.http.retryHandler.count"` | `Integer` | The maximum number of times a request to a remote server should be retried in case of an error. |  `3`  | 1.9.6 |  Yes  | Session Configuration |

| `"aether.transport.http.retryHandler.intervalMax"` | `Long` | The maximum retry interval in millis of request to a remote server above which the request should be aborted instead. In theory, a malicious server could tell Maven "come back after 100 years" that would stall the build for some.

| `"aether.transport.jdk.maxConcurrentRequests"` | `Integer` | The hard limit of maximum concurrent requests JDK transport can do. This is a workaround for the fact, that in HTTP/2 mode, JDK HttpClient initializes this value to Integer.MAX_VALUE (!) and lowers it on first response from the remote server (but it may be too late). See JDK bug <a href="https://bugs.openjdk.org/browse/JDK-8225647">JDK-8225647</a> for details. |  `100`  | 2.0.0 |  Yes  | Session Configuration |

| `"aether.trustedChecksumsSource.summaryFile.originAware"` | `Boolean` | Is source origin aware? |  `true`  | 1.9.0 |  No  | Session Configuration |
| `"aether.updateCheckManager.sessionState"` | `String` | Manages the session state, i.e. influences if the same download requests to artifacts/metadata will happen multiple times within the same RepositorySystemSession. If "enabled" will enable the session state. If "bypass" will enable bypassing (i.e. store all artifact ids/metadata ids which have been updates but not evaluating those). All other values lead to disabling the session state completely. |  `"enabled"`  |  |  No  | Session Configuration |

This is useful for analyzing cache performance and effectiveness in development and testing scenarios. |  `false`  | 2.0.10 |  No  | Session Configuration |


All properties which have `yes` in the column `Supports Repo ID Suffix` can be optionally configured specifically for a repository id. In that case the configuration property needs to be suffixed with a period followed by the repository id of the repository to configure, e.g. `aether.connector.http.headers.central` for repository with id `central`.

## Property Type Conversion

If the value is not given in the target type the following conversions are applied.

From | To | With
--- | --- | ---
`String` | `boolean` | [`Boolean.parseBoolean(...)`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/Boolean.html#parseBoolean(java.lang.String))
`String` | `int` | [`Integer.parseInt(...)`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/Integer.html#parseInt(java.lang.String))
`String` | `long` | [`Long.parseLong(...)`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/Long.html#parseLong(java.lang.String))
`String` | `float` | [`Float.parseFloat(...)`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/Float.html#parseFloat(java.lang.String))

## Set Configuration from Apache Maven

To set one of the configuration options from above just use system variables. As system variables only support String values the type conversion mentioned above needs to be leveraged.
Sometimes Maven uses different default values than the Maven Resolver itself or tries to extract certain values from the `settings.xml`. For details refer to [`DefaultRepositorySystemSessionFactory`](https://github.com/apache/maven/blob/master/impl/maven-core/src/main/java/org/apache/maven/internal/aether/DefaultRepositorySystemSessionFactory.java).
