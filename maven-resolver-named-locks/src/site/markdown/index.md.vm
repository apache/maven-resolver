Named locks are essentially locks that are assigned to some given (opaque) ID. If you work with multiple
resources that each can have unique ID assigned (i.e., file with an absolute path, some entities with unique ID),
then you can use named locks to make sure they are being protected from concurrent read and write actions.

Named locks provide support classes for implementations, and provide out of the box seven named lock implementations and three name mappers.

Following implementations are "local" (local to JVM) named lock implementations:

- `rwlock-local` implemented in `org.eclipse.aether.named.providers.LocalReadWriteLockNamedLockFactory` that uses
  JVM `java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantReadWriteLock`.
- `semaphore-local` implemented in `org.eclipse.aether.named.providers.LocalSemaphoreNamedLockFactory` that uses
  JVM `java.util.concurrent.Semaphore`.
- `noop` implemented in `org.eclipse.aether.named.providers.NoopNamedLockFactory` that uses no locking.

Following named lock implementations use underlying OS advisory file locking:

- `file-lock` implemented in `org.eclipse.aether.named.providers.FileLockNamedLockFactory` that uses
  JVM `java.nio.channels.FileLock`.

Note about `file-lock` implementation: it uses OS advisory file locking, hence, concurrently running Maven processes
all set up to use `file-loxk` implementation can safely share one local repository. This is almost certain on
local file systems across all operating systems. In case of NFS mounts, file advisory locking MAY work if NFSv4+
used with complete setup (with all the necessary services like `RPC` and `portmapper` needed to implement advisory
file locking, check your NFS and/or OS manuals for details). In short: if your (local or remote) FS correctly support
and implements advisory locking, it should work. Local FS usually does, while with NFS your mileage may vary.

Finally, "distributed" named lock implementations are the following (separate modules which require additional dependencies and remote services):

- `rwlock-redisson` implemented in `org.eclipse.aether.named.redisson.RedissonReadWriteLockNamedLockFactory`.
- `semaphore-redisson` implemented in `org.eclipse.aether.named.redisson.RedissonSemaphoreNamedLockFactory`.
- `semaphore-hazelcast-client` implemented in `org.eclipse.aether.named.hazelcast.HazelcastClientCPSemaphoreNamedLockFactory`.
- `semaphore-hazelcast` implemented in `org.eclipse.aether.named.hazelcast.HazelcastCPSemaphoreNamedLockFactory`.

Local named locks are only suited within one JVM with a multithreaded build.
Sharing a local repository between multiple Maven processes (i.e., on a busy CI server) requires a distributed named lock!

The aforementioned (opaque) IDs need to be mapped from artifacts and metadata.

Out of the box, name mapper implementations are the following:

- `static` implemented in `org.eclipse.aether.internal.impl.synccontext.named.StaticNameMapper`.
- `gav` implemented in `org.eclipse.aether.internal.impl.synccontext.named.GAVNameMapper`.
- `discriminating` implemented in `org.eclipse.aether.internal.impl.synccontext.named.DiscriminatingNameMapper`.
- `file-gav` implemented in `org.eclipse.aether.internal.impl.synccontext.named.FileGAVNameMapper`.
