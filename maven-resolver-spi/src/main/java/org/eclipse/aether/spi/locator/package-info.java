/**
 * A lightweight service locator infrastructure to help components acquire dependent components. The implementation of
 * the repository system is decomposed into many sub components that interact with each other via interfaces, allowing
 * an application to customize the system by swapping in different implementation classes for these interfaces. The
 * service locator defined by this package is one means for components to get hold of the proper implementation for its
 * dependencies. While not the most popular approach to component wiring, this service locator enables applications
 * that do not wish to pull in more sophisticated solutions like dependency injection containers to have a small
 * footprint. Therefore, all components should implement {@link org.eclipse.aether.spi.locator.Service} to support this
 * goal.
 *
 * @deprecated Use some out-of-the-box DI implementation instead.
