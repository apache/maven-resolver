standalone files attached to the issue, not as text embedded in the issue description or a comment.

When submitting patches, please follow the existing code style. The corresponding formatter settings for some IDEs can
be taken from the [Maven Code Style](http://maven.apache.org/developers/committer-environment.html#Maven_Code_Style)
