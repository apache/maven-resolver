/**
 * Abstract base class for dependency graph transformers that resolve version and scope conflicts among dependencies.
 * For a given set of conflicting nodes, one node will be chosen as the winner. How losing nodes are handled depends
 * on the configured verbosity level: they may be removed entirely, have their children removed, or be left in place
 * with conflict information. The exact rules by which a winning node and its effective scope are determined are
 * controlled by user-supplied implementations of {@link VersionSelector}, {@link ScopeSelector},
 * {@link OptionalitySelector} and {@link ScopeDeriver}.
 * <p>
 * <strong>Available Implementations:</strong>
 * <ul>
 * <li><strong>{@link PathConflictResolver}</strong> - Recommended high-performance implementation with O(N) complexity</li>
 * <li><strong>{@link ClassicConflictResolver}</strong> - Legacy implementation for backward compatibility (O(NÂ²) worst-case)</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * <strong>Implementation Selection Guide:</strong>
 * <ul>
 * <li><strong>New Projects:</strong> Use {@link PathConflictResolver} for optimal performance</li>
 * <li><strong>Large Multi-Module Projects:</strong> Use {@link PathConflictResolver} to avoid performance bottlenecks</li>
 * <li><strong>Maven 4+ Environments:</strong> Use {@link PathConflictResolver} for best build performance</li>
 * <li><strong>Legacy Compatibility:</strong> Use {@link ClassicConflictResolver} only when exact Maven 3.x behavior is required</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * <strong>Usage Example:</strong>
 * <pre>{@code
 * // Recommended: High-performance path-based resolver
 * DependencyGraphTransformer transformer = new ChainedDependencyGraphTransformer(
 *     new PathConflictResolver(
 *         new NearestVersionSelector(),
 *         new JavaScopeSelector(),
 *         new SimpleOptionalitySelector(),
 *         new JavaScopeDeriver()),
 *     // other transformers...
 * );
 *
 * // Legacy: Classic resolver for backward compatibility
 * DependencyGraphTransformer legacyTransformer = new ChainedDependencyGraphTransformer(
 *     new ClassicConflictResolver(
 *         new NearestVersionSelector(),
 *         new JavaScopeSelector(),
 *         new SimpleOptionalitySelector(),
 *         new JavaScopeDeriver()),
 *     // other transformers...
 * );
 * }</pre>
 * <p>
 * <strong>Verbosity Levels and Conflict Handling:</strong>
 * <ul>
 * <li><strong>NONE (default):</strong> Creates a clean dependency tree without duplicate artifacts.
 *     Losing nodes are completely removed from the graph, so are cycles as well.</li>
 * <li><strong>STANDARD:</strong> Retains losing nodes for analysis but removes their children to prevent
 *     duplicate dependencies. Special handling for version ranges: redundant nodes may still be removed
 *     if multiple versions of the same artifact exist. Losing nodes link back to the winner via
 *     {@link #NODE_DATA_WINNER} and preserve original scope/optionality information. This mode removes cycles only,
 *     while conflict nodes/duplicates are left in place. Graphs in this verbosity level cannot be resolved,
 *     their purpose is for analysis only.</li>
 * <li><strong>FULL:</strong> Preserves the complete original graph structure including all conflicts and cycles.
 *     All nodes remain with their children, but conflict information is recorded for analysis.
 *     Graphs in this verbosity level cannot be resolved, their purpose is for analysis only.</li>
 * </ul>
 * The verbosity level is controlled by the {@link #CONFIG_PROP_VERBOSE} configuration property.
 * <p>
 * <strong>Conflict Metadata:</strong> In STANDARD and FULL modes, the keys {@link #NODE_DATA_ORIGINAL_SCOPE}
 * and {@link #NODE_DATA_ORIGINAL_OPTIONALITY} are used to store the original scope and optionality of each node.
 * Obviously, dependency trees with verbosity STANDARD or FULL are not suitable for artifact resolution unless
 * a filter is employed to exclude the duplicate dependencies.
 * <p>
 * <strong>Conflict ID Processing Pipeline:</strong>
 * <ol>
 * <li><strong>{@link ConflictMarker}:</strong> Assigns conflict IDs based on GACE (groupId:artifactId:classifier:extension)
 *     coordinates, grouping artifacts that differ only in version (partitions the graph, assigning same conflict IDs
 *     to nodes belonging to same conflict group).</li>
 * <li><strong>{@link ConflictIdSorter}:</strong> Creates topological ordering of conflict IDs and detects cycles</li>
 * <li><strong>ConflictResolver implementation:</strong> Uses the sorted conflict IDs to resolve conflicts in dependency order</li>
 * </ol>
 * This transformer will query the keys {@link TransformationContextKeys#CONFLICT_IDS},
 * {@link TransformationContextKeys#SORTED_CONFLICT_IDS}, {@link TransformationContextKeys#CYCLIC_CONFLICT_IDS} for
 * existing information about conflict ids. In absence of this information, it will automatically invoke the
 * {@link ConflictIdSorter} to calculate it.
