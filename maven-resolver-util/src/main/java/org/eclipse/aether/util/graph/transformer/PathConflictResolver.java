/**
 * A high-performance dependency graph transformer that resolves version and scope conflicts among dependencies.
 * This is the recommended conflict resolver implementation that provides O(N) performance characteristics,
 * significantly improving upon the O(N²) worst-case performance of {@link ClassicConflictResolver}.
 * <p>
 * For a given set of conflicting nodes, one node will be chosen as the winner. How losing nodes are handled
 * depends on the configured verbosity level: they may be removed entirely, have their children removed, or
 * be left in place with conflict information. The exact rules by which a winning node and its effective scope
 * are determined are controlled by user-supplied implementations of {@link ConflictResolver.VersionSelector}, {@link ConflictResolver.ScopeSelector},
 * {@link ConflictResolver.OptionalitySelector} and {@link ConflictResolver.ScopeDeriver}.
 * <p>
 * <strong>Performance Characteristics:</strong>
 * <ul>
 * <li><strong>Time Complexity:</strong> O(N) where N is the number of dependency nodes</li>
 * <li><strong>Memory Usage:</strong> Creates a parallel tree structure for conflict-free processing</li>
 * <li><strong>Scalability:</strong> Excellent performance on large multi-module projects</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * <strong>Algorithm Overview:</strong>
 * <ol>
 * <li><strong>Path Tree Construction:</strong> Builds a cycle-free parallel tree structure from the input
 *     dependency graph, where each {@code Path} represents a unique route to a dependency node</li>
 * <li><strong>Conflict Partitioning:</strong> Groups paths by conflict ID (based on groupId:artifactId:classifier:extension coordinates)</li>
 * <li><strong>Topological Processing:</strong> Processes conflict groups in topologically sorted order</li>
 * <li><strong>Winner Selection:</strong> Uses provided selectors to choose winners within each conflict group</li>
 * <li><strong>Graph Transformation:</strong> Applies changes back to the original dependency graph</li>
 * </ol>
 * <p>
 * <strong>Key Differences from {@link ClassicConflictResolver}:</strong>
 * <ul>
 * <li><strong>Performance:</strong> O(N) vs O(N²) time complexity</li>
 * <li><strong>Memory Strategy:</strong> Uses parallel tree structure vs in-place graph modification</li>
 * <li><strong>Cycle Handling:</strong> Explicitly breaks cycles during tree construction</li>
 * <li><strong>Processing Order:</strong> Level-by-level from root vs depth-first traversal</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * <strong>When to Use:</strong>
 * <ul>
 * <li>Default choice for all new projects and Maven 4+ installations</li>
 * <li>Large multi-module projects with many dependencies</li>
 * <li>Performance-critical build environments</li>
 * <li>Any scenario where {@link ClassicConflictResolver} shows performance bottlenecks</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * <strong>Implementation Note:</strong> This conflict resolver builds a cycle-free "parallel" structure based on the
 * passed-in dependency graph, and applies operations level by level starting from the root. The parallel {@code Path}
 * tree ensures that cycles in the original graph don't affect the conflict resolution algorithm's performance.

     * Represents a unique path within the dependency graph from the root to a specific {@link DependencyNode}.

     * <p>
     * <strong>Key Concepts:</strong>
     * <ul>
     * <li><strong>Path Uniqueness:</strong> Each {@code Path} instance represents a distinct route through
     *     the dependency graph, even if multiple paths lead to the same {@code DependencyNode}</li>
     * <li><strong>Cycle-Free Structure:</strong> The {@code Path} tree is guaranteed to be acyclic, even
     *     when the original dependency graph contains cycles</li>
     * <li><strong>Parallel Structure:</strong> This creates a "clean" tree alongside the original "dirty"
     *     graph for efficient processing</li>
     * </ul>
     * <p>
     * <strong>Example:</strong> If dependency A appears in the graph via two different routes:
     * <pre>
     * Root → B → A (path 1)
     * Root → C → A (path 2)
     * </pre>
     * Two separate {@code Path} instances will be created, both pointing to the same {@code DependencyNode} A,
     * but representing different paths through the dependency tree.
     * <p>
     * <strong>Memory Optimization:</strong> While this creates additional objects, it enables the algorithm
     * to process conflicts in O(N) time rather than O(N²), making it much more efficient for large graphs.
     * <p>
     * <strong>Conflict Resolution:</strong> Paths are grouped by conflict ID (based on groupId:artifactId:classifier:extension coordinates),
     * and the conflict resolution algorithm can efficiently process each group independently.
