# Maven Resolver Supplier

This simple module serves the purpose to "bootstrap" resolver when there is no desire to use 
[Eclipse Sisu](https://eclipse.dev/sisu/). It provides one simple class 
`org.eclipse.aether.supplier.RepositorySystemSupplier` that implements `Supplier<RepositorySystem>`
and supplies ready-to-use `RepositorySystem` instances.

The supplier class is written in such way, to allow easy customization if needed: just extend the class and override
method one need (all methods are protected).

Consumer/users of this module **must provide SLF4J backend**. Resolver uses `slf4j-api` for logging purposes, but this 
module does NOT provide any backend for it. It is the consumer/user obligation to provide one at runtime.

Version of `maven-resolver-supplier` artifact used **must be strictly aligned** with other Resolver artifacts 
on classpath.

By default, "full resolver experience" is provided:
* for connector, the connector-basic is provided
* for transport the two transport-file and transport-http implementations are provided. If Wagon is needed, add
  transport-wagon as dependency, and customize `RepositorySystemSupplier` to include it. This makes it available, but
  NOT used yet! To use it, you still need to configure resolver to favor Wagon over native HTTP.

# Resolver configuration

The supplier will provide only a "vanilla" instance. To configure resolver, use session user (or 
configuration) properties, when constructing session. All the configuration options are available as 
[listed here](https://maven.apache.org/resolver/configuration.html).

# Extending Resolver

Extending supplied resolver is simple, and basically requires same three steps for whatever extra you want to include
(like Wagon transport, distributed locking, etc).

First, you need to include needed module (with transitive deps) to your dependencies.

Second, you need to customize `RepositorySystemSupplier` to make new components (`WagonTransporterFactory`, or 
distributed lock factories) available.

Third, you need to configure session (via user of config properties) to make Resolver use newly added components.
